    <h1>Basic HTML Display Features</h1>

    <p style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">
        A basic page needs only a bare minimum of programming. Graphics are an important part of Web pages but so too
        are words.
        I look upon the Web as a medium for ideas and the use of new technologies, but not the other way around. A Web
        page tells
        a great story with great graphical and analytical presentation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Using the "View" option look at the source code for this document. The background color and the text declared in
        the body
        refer to a coding system that combines a system of numbers and letters to create thousands of possible color
        choices.
        The body color indicates white and the text as being black. I could have just written in "white" and "black"
        instead of
        these codes.
    </p>

    <p>Here is an example of a horizontal rule:</p>


    <p>To begin, we can change the</p>

    <p style="font-size: large;"><b>header size</b></p>

    <p>
        and <span style="color: blue;">color</span> <span style="color: red;">of</span> <span
            style="color: green;">letters</span> seen on the screen. The
        <span style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold;">font size</span> can be changed as well, and actually gives
        more choices.
    </p>

    <p>
        We can also change the appearance of words on the screen. This shows some differing word types in a blocked
        quote. Now is the
        <em>time</em> for all good <strong>people</strong> to <strong> come</strong> to the <em>aid of their</em>
        country.
    </p>

    <p>That was also an example of a nested command.
